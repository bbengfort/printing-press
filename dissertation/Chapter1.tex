Ubiquitous computing is becoming the norm.
    More users are mobile
    Non-human users (IoT is generating a lot of data)
    Applications are global
    Requires transparent persistence

Oceanstore provides a model for untrusted global-scale data
    Requires connectivity, security, durability (consistency), divorced from location
    Oceanstore model relies on encryption and async commit with conflict resolution
    Two tiers for updates: Byzantine quorum and eventual consistency layer

Cloud revolution
    The model has changed: client-server interactions and siloed data (not files)
    Trusted replicas are available across the globe (or secured with encryption/SUNDR)
    Updates are still too fast, however, centralization means that consistency is now the number one issue.
    FIGURE: locations of cloud computing data centers

Toward Edge and Fog computing
    Data systems are becoming increasingly complex (many publishers, few subscribers, distributed accesses)
    Sensor networks, energy platforms, self-driving vehicle networks
    Greater localization is required

Our vision: planetary-scale data storage
    First tier: strong, resilient, fast consensus with hierarchical consensus
    Second tier: highly available eventual consistency federated with strong consistency
    Adaptiveness: online monitoring and network adaptation

Contributions:
    Design, implementation, and evaluation of hierarchical consensus
    Design, implementation, and evaluation of federated consistency
    Design, implementation, and evaluation of bandit-based anti-entropy
    Design and implementation of planetary-scale key/value store
    Design and implementation of a planetary-scale file system
    Description and discussion of distributed systems in the very wide area
    Description and discussion of dependent scaling of consensus algorithms
