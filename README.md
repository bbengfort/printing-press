## About

This is a repository for collaborative document editing via Github. Many of my co-authors enjoy writing in LaTeX or other formats, and do so on their localhosts using their own build systems. Although tools like [Overleaf](http://www.overleaf.com) and [ShareLaTeX](http://sharelatex.com) exist (and indeed may be used with many of these documents), it's occassionally just easier to push and pull to a Github Repository.
