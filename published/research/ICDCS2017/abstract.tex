Groups of strongly consistent devices can efficiently order events under ideal (data
center) conditions, but become less effective in dynamic and heterogeneous environments.
Weakly consistent devices efficiently tolerate both faults and dynamic conditions but are
slow to converge on a single ordering of system events.
We propose “federated consistency”, which combines the strengths of both approaches into
a single protocol.
Federated groups use a strongly consistent inner core of devices to maintain a totally
ordered, fault-tolerant sequence of events.
A cloud of weakly-consistent devices disseminates orderings and enables progress despite
varying connectivity and partitions.
Though the constituent sub-protocols take different (nearly opposite) approaches to
resolving conflicts; we show that expanding distributed version vectors with a forte
component allows them to inter-operate effectively.
