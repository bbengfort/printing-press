Comments to the authors:
    In this paper, a self-organizing particle swarm optimization method based on
    evolutionary design is proposed for collective problem solving. In this
    design, the evolutionary computing techniques has been applied to design
    particles, not only to optimize the parameters for movement but also the
    structure of controlling finite state machines that enable collective
    intelligence. Based on such design, the particles in the swarm exhibit
    emergent, self-organizing behavior. The over-all quality of this paper is
    above the acceptance line.  However, there are some comments need to be
    addressed to further improve the manuscript as follows:
    1.  Figure 1 and Figure 6 convey not too much information, could the
    authors re-plot these figure more informatively?
    2.  What is the x axis and y axis in Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and
    Figure 5? These information should be provided in these figures.
    3.  A comparison with other evolutionary based methods, such as original
    PSO, in the simulation section is highly appreciated.

Comments to the authors:
    An interesting paper, and well written. There are apparently enough details to
    reproduce the experiments, at least in principle, which is a good point.
    Just a few minor remarks (see below).

    -------------------
    p. 2
    "we are more interested in the, opposite application, using evolutionary
    techniques to create particles that exhibit swarm behavior and collective
    problem solving."
    It would be  very interesting to try to apply the same method to automatically
    "build" particles and rules  in the context of Particle Swarm optimisation.
    Any suggestion how it could be possible?

    p. 2
    "The task is competitive, as there are two teams in the environment competing
    for the resources and therefore the simulation is non-deterministic "
    Competition does not necessarily implies randomness, and could be deterministic.
    Please reformulate.

    p. 6
    "The simulated world was a 3000 x3000 world "

Comments to the authors:
    A fascinating account of a multi-agent system that combines Reynold's flocking rules with working
    memories and finite state machines. The system is tested on a locate-and-collect task, and compared to
    the best human evolved agent.  The work would really come alive if an online video of the tasks could be
    made available. There is some confusion between swarms and flocks: these are flocks by virtue of rule no.
    2 (alignment). The paper is well organised and written and, although a longer and more complete account
    would have been desirable, fairly well explained given the submission constraints.
