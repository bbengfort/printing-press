Distributed consensus algorithms are the primary mechanism of implementing strong
consistency in geo-replicated data stores.
Consistency is guaranteed by the explicit sequential ordering of accesses or locks and
leader based consensus protocols minimize the number of messages required to apply a
command without conflict detection in a fault-tolerant manner.
However, distributed consensus algorithms must reject inconsistent updates to the system
and as a result do not provide high availability or throughput.
In this paper we describe \emph{Hierarchical Consensus}, a new decentralized consensus
protocol which distributes consensus decisions to multiple tiers of consensus groups
according to shared accesses so as to maintain implicit dependencies.
Hierarchical Consensus is unique in that it can efficiently guarantee the strict total
ordering on replicated logs in the wider area even in the presence of partitions and
varying connectivity. We will show its correctness and describe an experimental
methodology that we will use to demonstrate durable, highly-available, and strongly
consistent accesses in systems that scale from small to large networks.
