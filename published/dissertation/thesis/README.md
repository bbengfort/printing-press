# Requirements for Proposal and Dissertation

This is from Bobby. We can discuss specifics, but I think it lays out
the a very sweet set of requirements and goals.

## Proposal

### Talk/Exam


 - must not waste time talking about the popularity of the
    Internet, social networks, mobile systems, *
      - get to the point.  fast.

 - must put proposed work in context of prior research

 - must present specific and falsifiable hypothesis within the first
five minutes
     - 'improving wireless networks' is not a reasonable hypothesis

 - must describe how prior/proposed work satisfies hypothesis

 - must be able to articulate and defend assumptions, implied or explicit

 - must be able to to defend why the proposed work is the proper
      course of action

 - must be able to articulate why specific lines are not being explored

 - must be able to state what will be open even if proposed work is successful

 - must describe fallback plan if proposed work is not successful

 - must be able to summarize and explain details of papers on the reading list
     - OK to consult paper, but not OK to say, 'I was not expecting a question
        on that paper'.
     - be able to put paper in context of related papers


### Document

 - at most twenty pages, including references
 - must identify hypotheses

 - must describe prior work in support
 - detail what is left to do
 - why the proposed work supports hypothesis


### Timeline

  - produce document at least max(three weeks, as agreed with committee member) before proposal date

  - must meet with each committee member at least once prior to proposal to discuss document and proposed work

     - incumbent upon student to choose committee and timeline such that this is possible

## Dissertation

### Defense

 - talk should identify hypothesis
    - hypothesis should be falsifiable

 - must be able to *defend* the work

 - must be able to articulate why the hypothesis is satisfied

 - must be able to defend assumptions made in work
     - committee members should not be able to surprise student
        with assumptions student had not yet thought about

 - must be able to answer questions about any related work, and any
      general computer science questions pertaining to techniques
      used in dissertation

 - must be able to defend details of experiments
     - must be able to describe what the experiment settings were,
        why there were chosen, what the limitations were, how
        valid the results are, what statistical significance the results
        have, how the experiment could be re-done in retrospect, and why
        this was not done

### Timeline

  - produce document at least max(three weeks, as agreed with committee member)
     before proposal date
       - good idea to produce chapters as they come ready and get them
         read by committee member.
       - write well, and get edits from good writers, perhaps in the
          literature departments
       - unlikely to get poorly written 250 pages of glop read by anyone

  - must meet with each committee member at least once prior to defense
     to discuss document and defense
        - incumbent upon student to choose committee
           and timeline such that this is possible
        - ideally meet with committee members once a month
           after committee is set

### Dissertation Document

 - must be written by student, not by advisor or
    co-authors of papers

 - must be technical prose,  no colloquialisms
     - be precise
     - back up claims with cites
     - be careful with adjectives and be ready to defend them
     - give reader information to decide whether something
        is very *, extremely *, ...
     - be ready to back up 'optimal' whenever it is written down
     - define units, watch out for 'overhead'

 - must include an intro that puts work in perspective
     - describes why the problem is interesting (optionally important)

  - must identify falsifiable hypothesis

  - must describe why the work satisfies hypothesis

  - each research chapter should be more than merely published  (page-limited)
     conference papers
       - if there is an obvious experiment that could not  be included
          in the conference paper, it MUST be included in the dissertation

  - must contain _comprehensive_ description of related work.  the bar for
     a dissertation is much much higher than a conference or even journal
     paper

 - conclusions should describe what the student learned, what the hard problems
    were, and outline open problems
       - conclusions are where a personal statement about the work can be
           formalized.  use the opportunity.
