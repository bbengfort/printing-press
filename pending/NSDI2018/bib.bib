ABSTRACT="There is an increasing need for Internet hosts to be able to
quickly and efficiently learn the distance, in terms of metrics such as
latency or bandwidth, between Internet hosts. For example, to select the
nearest of multiple equal-content web servers. This paper explores
technical issues related to the creation of a public infrastructure
service to provide such information. In so doing, we suggests an
architecture, called IDMaps, whereby Internet distance information is
distributed over the Internet, using IP multicast groups, in the form of
a virtual distance map. Systems listening to the groups can estimate the
distance between any pair of IP addresses by running a spanning tree
algorithm over the received distance map. We also presents the results
of experiments that give preliminary evidence supporting the
architecture. This work thus lays the initial foundation for future work
in this new area.",

                 is a system for evaulating trust. It is essentially a

                 transferred to the key-ids that satisfy
                 AuthorityStruct. <AuthorityStruct> is a function on
                 key-ids (it can be a simple key-id or a program that

                 (described below). Queries to PolicyMaker are of the

                 <ActionString> is a string constructed by the

                 except that the filters of assertions will take action
                 strings as input and returns a boolean status (filters
                 may also append annotations to the action strings).
                 Assertions are either local (called policies, and
                 having the POLICY keyword as the <source>) or signed
                 binding of an authority structure to a filter (called
                 certificates). Input to filters consist of the action

                  from a variety of failures, including file
                  corruption, virus and worm infestations, and user
                  mistakes. However, using versions to recover from
                  data-corrupting events requires a human to determine
                  precisely which files and versions to restore. We
                  can create more meaningful versions and enhance the
                  value of those versions by capturing the causal
                  connections among files, facilitating selection and
                  recovery of precisely the right versions after data
                  corrupting events.  <p> We determine when to create
                  new versions of files automatically using the causal
                  relationships among files. The literature on
                  versioning file systems usually examines two
                  extremes of possible version-creation algorithms:
                  open-to-close versioning and versioning on every
                  write. We evaluate causal versions of these two
                  algorithms and introduce two additional
                  causality-based algorithms: Cycle-Avoidance and
                  Graph-Finesse.  <p> We show that capturing and
                  maintaining causal relationships imposes less than
                  7% overhead on a versioning system, providing
                  benefit at low cost. We then show that
                  Cycle-Avoidance provides more meaningful versions of
                  files created during concurrent program execution,
                  with overhead comparable to open/close
                  versioning. GraphFinesse provides even greater
                  control, frequently at comparable overhead, but
                  sometimes at unacceptable overhead. Versioning on
                  every write is an interesting extreme case, but is
                  far too costly to be useful in practice."

ABSTRACT="There is an increasing number of Internet applications that
attempt to optimize their network communication by considering the
network distance across which data is transferred. Such applications
range from replication management to mobile agent applications. One
major problem of these applications is to efficiently acquire distance
information for large computer networks. This paper presents an approach
to create a global view on the Internet, a so-called network distance
map, which realizes a hierarchical decomposition of the network into
regions and which allows to estimate the network distance between any
two hosts. This view is not only a single snapshot but is dynamically
adapted to the continuously changing network conditions. The main idea
is to use a certain set of hosts for performing distance measurements
and to use the so gained information for estimating the distance between
arbitrary hosts. A hierarchical clustering provides the notion of
regions and allows to coordinate the measurements in such a way that the
resulting network load is minimized. An experimental evaluation on the
basis of 119 globally distributed measurement servers shows that already
a small number of measurement servers allows to construct fairly
accurate distance maps at low costs.",

Internet from which the relative distances between points on the
Internet can be gauged \cite{FJPZGJ99}. Distance map is a service that
many distributed systems and applications can benefit; for example, a
common method to improve user perceived performance of the Internet is
to place data and server mirrors closer to the clients. When a client
tries to access a mirrored server, which mirror should it access? With
IDMaps, the closest mirror can be determined based on distance estimates
between the client and the mirrors. In this paper we investigate both
graph theoretic methods and {\em ad hoc} heuristics for instrumenting
the Internet to obtain distance maps. We evaluate the efficacy of the
resulting distance maps by comparing the determinations of closest
replica using known topology against those obtained from the distance
maps.",

AUTHOR="Fan, Li and Cao, Pei and Almeida, Jussara and Broder, Andrei Z.",
TITLE="Summary Cache: A Scalable Wide-Area Web Cache Sharing Protocol",

ABSTRACT="The sharing of caches among Web proxies is an important
technique to reduce Web traffic and alleviate network bottlenecks.
Nevertheless it is not widely deployed due to the overhead of existing
protocols. In this paper we propose a new protocol called ''Summary
Cache''; each proxy keeps a summary of the URLs of cached documents of
each participating proxy and checks these summaries for potential hits
before sending any queries. Two factors contribute to the low overhead:
the summaries are updated only periodically, and the summary
representations are economical -- as low as 8 bits per entry. Using
trace-driven simulations and a prototype implementation, we show that
compared to the existing Internet Cache Protocol (ICP), Summary Cache
reduces the number of inter-cache messages by a factor of 25 to 60,
reduces the bandwidth consumption by over 50%, and eliminates between
30% to 95% of the CPU overhead, while at the same time maintaining
almost the same hit ratio as ICP. Hence Summary Cache enables cache
sharing among a large number of proxies.",

                  file system protocols, and by protocols that are
                  designed specifically for content based
                  access. Compatiblity with existing file system
                  protocols is provided by introducing the concept of
                  a virtual directory. Virtual directory names are
                  interpreted as queries, and thus provide flexible
                  associative access to files and directories in a
                  manner compatible with existing software. Rapid
                  attribute-based access to file system contents is
                  implemented by automatic extraction and indexing of
                  key properties of file system objects. The automatic
                  indexing of files and directories is called semantic
                  because user programmable transducers use
                  information about the semantics of updated file
                  system objects to extract the properties for
                  indexing.  Experimental results from a semantic file
                  system implementation support the thesis that
                  semantic file systems present a more effective
                  storage abstraction than do traditional tree
                  structured file systems for information sharing and
                  command level programming.",

                 system accessible via the VFS interface. It provides
                 highly available and reliable storage for files and
                 guarantees that file operations are executed atomically
                 in spite of concurrency and failures. It uses a novel
                 variation of the primary copy replication technique
                 that provides good performance because it allows us to
                 trade disk accesses for network communication. Harp is
                 intended to be used within a file service in a
                 distributed network; in our current implementation, it
                 is accessed via NFS. Preliminary performance results
                 indicated that Harp provides equal or better response
                 time and system capacity than an ureplicated
                 implementaion of NFS that uses Unix files directly.",

                 and prefetching to reduce file read latencies by
                 exploiting application level hints about future I/O
                 accesses. We argue that systems that disclose
                 high-level knowledge can transfer optimization
                 information across module boundaries in a manner
                 consistent with sound software engineering principles.
                 Such Transparent Informed Prefetching (TIP) systems
                 provide a technique for converting the high through put
                 of new technologies such as disk arrays and
                 log-structured file systems into low latency for
                 applications. Our preliminary experiments show that
                 even without a high-throughput I/O sub system TIP
                 yields reduced execution time of up to 30% for
                 applications obtaining data from a remote file server
                 and up to 13% for applications obtaining data from a
                 single local disk. These experiments indicate that
                 greater performance benefits will be available when TIP
                 is integrated with low level resource management

  abstract = "Users rarely consider running network file systems over
                  slow or wide-area networks, as the performance would
                  be unacceptable and the bandwidth consumption too
                  high. Nonetheless, efficient remote file access
                  would often be desirable over such
                  networks—particularly when high latency makes remote
                  login sessions unresponsive. Rather than run
                  interactive programs such as editors remotely, users
                  could run the programs locally and manipulate remote
                  files through the file system. To do so, however,
                  would require a network file system that consumes
                  less bandwidth than most current file systems.  <p>
                  This paper presents LBFS, a network file system
                  designed for low-bandwidth networks. LBFS exploits
                  similarities between files or versions of the same
                  file to save bandwidth. It avoids sending data over
                  the network when the same data can already be found
                  in the server's file system or the client's
                  cache. Using this technique in conjunction with
                  conventional compression and caching, LBFS consumes
                  over an order of magnitude less bandwidth than
                  traditional network file systems on common
                  workloads.",

                 log-structured file system; there are too many details
                 missing for my taste. But the discussion of cleaning
                 and, in particular, cleaning policies is quite
                 detailed; the paper compares a greedy heuristic that
                 cleans segments with least utilization, with a
                 cost/benefit heuristic that tends to clean segments
                 with old (and rarely-changing) data with higher
                 utilization than young segments; the cost/benefit
                 heuristic works significantly better. The intuition is
                 that old data is unlikely to die soon, so we might just
                 as well reclaim the free space associated with it now
                 and use it, instead of waiting for a long time until
                 utilization falls below the threshold of the greedy
                 heuristic. The file system maintains a segment usage
                 table to have data for this heuristic. The paper also
                 presents empirical data showing that the Sprite LFS is
                 much faster than SunOS FFS on small files, and that the
                 cleaning behaviour on real workloads is even better
                 than in the simulations they presented earlier. One
                 interesting statement was that the Sprite LFS is not
                 more complex than FFS: it needs log handling and the
                 cleaner, but can skip complex block allocation
                 algorithms and fsck.",

                 exponential rate and single disk access times remain
                 relatively constant, it is apparent that I/O bandwidth
                 is likely to become a bottleneck in the performance of
                 systems. One way to address this problem is by using
                 disk arrays, i.e., sets of relatively inexpensive disks
                 which can improve I/O bandwidth via parallel access.
                 The problem with this approach is that simply using
                 disk arrays can drastically reduce reliability. The
                 approach of RAID is to use redundant disks of check
                 data to bring reliability up to acceptable levels
                 (i.e., failure rates better than expected useful life
                 of the disks). Five levels of the RAID design are
                 presented to address the issues of overhead cost (in
                 terms of number of disks), useable storage capacity,
                 and efficiency per disk for various read and write
                 scenarios (i.e, large vs. small). These issues were
                 considered in terms of {\em data rates} (supercomputer
                 applications) and {\em I/O rates} (transaction
                 systems). Level 5 RAID provides the best all around
                 performance by distributing check data across the data
                 disks to increase parallelism.",

  ABSTRACT = {
  Most computer science educators hold strong opinions about the
``right'' approach to teaching introductory level programming.
Unfortunately, we have comparatively little hard evidence about the
effectiveness of these various approaches because we generally lack
the infrastructure to obtain sufficiently detailed data about novices'
programming habits.

To gain insight into students' programming habits, we developed
Marmoset, a project snapshot and submission system.  Like existing
project submission systems, Marmoset allows students to submit
versions of their projects to a central server, which automatically
tests them and records the results.  Unlike existing systems, Marmoset
also collects fine-grained code snapshots as students work on
projects: each time a student saves her work, it is automatically
committed to a CVS repository.

We believe the data collected by Marmoset will be a rich source of
insight about learning to program and software evolution in general.
To validate the effectiveness of our tool, we performed an experiment
which found a statistically significant correlation between warnings
reported by a static analysis tool and failed unit tests.

To make fine-grained code evolution data more useful, we present a
data schema which allows a variety of useful queries to be more easily
formulated and answered.

  ABSTRACT = {
Much research has been done on techniques to teach students
how to program.  However, it is usually difficult to quantify
exactly how students work.
Instructors typically only see students' work when
they submit their projects or come to office hours.
Another common problem in introductory programming courses
is that student code is only subjected to rigorous
testing once it has been submitted.
Both of these problems can be viewed as a lack of feedback
between students and instructors.

We have built an Eclipse plugin to address this lack
of feedback.  The plugin has two main functions.
First, it captures, to a central CVS repository,
the complete state of a student's project every time
he or she saves, adds, or removes a file.
This produces a fine-grained history of the evolution of
each student's project.
Second, the plugin allows the student to submit his or her
project to a central server.  The submit server
automatically compiles and performs limited testing of the student's submission,
providing feedback on how close the project
is to fulfilling the project requirements.

Our goal is to provide instructors and researchers
with far more detailed information about how students learn and work,
and provide feedback to students that will help them
focus on achieving the goals of the projects we assign.

                 mechanisms that tailor file system resource management
                 to the needs of I/O-intensive applications. In
                 particular, we show how to use application-disclosed
                 access patterns (hints) to expose and exploit I/O
                 parallelism, and to dynamically allocate file buffers
                 among three competing demands: prefetching hinted
                 blocks, caching hinted blocks for reuse, and caching
                 recently used data for unhinted accesses. Our approach
                 estimates the impact of alternative buffer allocations
                 on application execution time and applies cost-benefit
                 analysis to allocate buffers where they will have the
                 greatest impact. We have implemented informed
                 prefetching and caching in Digitals OSF/1 operating
                 system and measured its performance on a 150 MHz Alpha
                 equipped with 15 disks running a range of applications.
                 Informed prefetching reduces the execution time of text
                 search, scientific visualization, relational database
                 queries, speech recognition, and object linking by
                 20-83\%. Informed caching reduces the execution time of
                 computational physics by up to 42\% and contributes to
                 the performance improvement of the object linker and
                 the database. Moreover, applied to multiprogrammed,
                 I/O-intensive workloads, informed prefetching and
                 caching increase overall throughput.",
  comment =      "See patterson:informed-tr for an earlier version.
                 Programs may give hints to the file system about what
                 they will read in the future, and in what order. Hints
                 are used for informed prefetching and informed caching.
                 Most interesting thing about this paper over the
                 earlier ones is the buffer management. Prefetcher and
                 demand fetcher both want buffers. LRU cache and hinted
                 cache both could supply buffers (thru replacement).
                 Each supplies a cost for giving up buffers and benefit
                 for getting more buffers. These are expressed in a
                 common 'currency', in terms of their expected effect on
                 I/O service time, and a manager takes buffers from one
                 and gives buffers to another when the benefits outweigh
                 the costs. All is based on a simple model, which is
                 further simplified in their implementation within
                 OSF/1. Performance looks good, they can keep more disks
                 busy in a parallel file system. Furthermore, informed
                 caching helps reduce the number of I/Os. Indeed they
                 'discover' MRU replacement policy automatically.",

		 System, a scalable distributed file system for large

		 same goals as previous distributed file systems, our
		 design has been driven by observations of our
		 application workloads and technological environment,
		 both current and anticipated, that reflect a marked
		 departure from some earlier file system assumptions.
		 This has led us to reexamine traditional choices and
		 explore radically different design points. The file
		 system has successfully met our storage needs. It is
		 widely deployed within Google as the storage platform
		 for the generation and processing of data used by our
		 service as well as research and development efforts
		 that require large data sets. The largest cluster to
		 date provides hundreds of terabytes of storage across
		 thousands of disks on over a thousand machines, and it
		 is concurrently accessed by hundreds of clients. In
		 this paper, we present file system interface extensions
		 designed to support distributed applications, discuss
		 many aspects of our design, and report measurements
		 from both micro-benchmarks and real world use.",

                  devices like notebook computers, MP3 players and
                  smart phones in their daily lives. Making sure that
                  data on these devices is available where needed and
                  backed up regularly is a time-consuming and
                  error-prone burden on users. In this paper, we
                  describe and evaluate PodBase, a system that
                  automates storage management on personal
                  devices. The system takes advantage of unused
                  storage and incidental connectivity to propagate the
                  system state and replicate files. PodBase ensures
                  the durability of data despite device loss or
                  failure; at the same time, it aims to make data
                  available on devices where it is useful.  PodBase
                  seeks to exploit available storage and pair- wise
                  device connections with little or no user
                  attention. Towards this goal, it relies on a
                  declarative specification of its replication goals
                  and uses linear optimization to compute a
                  replication plan that considers the current dis-
                  tribution of files, availability of storage, and
                  history of device connections. Results from a user
                  study in ten real households show that, under a wide
                  range of conditions, PodBase transparently manages
                  the durability and avail- ability of data on

                  the view, to simplify management. A view is a
                  semantic description of a set of files, specified as
                  a query on file attributes, and the ID of the device
                  on which they are stored. By examining and modifying
                  the views associated with a device, a user can
                  identify and control the files stored on it. This
                  approach allows users to reason about what is stored
                  where in the same way (semantic naming) as they
                  navigate their digital content. Thus, in serving as

  abstract = "Researchers have made great strides in improving the
		 fault tolerance of both centralized and replicated
		 systems against arbitrary (Byzantine) faults. However,
		 there are hard limits to how much can be done with
		 entirely untrusted components; for example, replicated
		 state machines cannot tolerate more than a third of
		 their replica population being Byzantine. In this
		 paper, we investigate how minimal trusted abstractions
		 can push through these hard limits in practical ways.
		 We propose Attested Append-Only Memory (A2M), a trusted
		 system facility that is small, easy to implement and
		 easy to verify formally. A2M provides the programming
		 abstraction of a trusted log, which leads to protocol
		 designs immune to equivocation -- the ability of a
		 faulty host to lie in different ways to different
		 clients or servers -- which is a common source of
		 Byzantine headaches. Using A2M, we improve upon the
		 state of the art in Byzantine-fault tolerant replicated
		 state machines, producing A2M-enabled protocols
		 (variants of Castro and Liskov{'}s PBFT) that remain
		 correct (linearizable) and keep making progress (live)
		 even when half the replicas are faulty, in contrast to
		 the previous upper bound. We also present an
		 A2M-enabled single-server shared storage protocol that
		 guarantees linearizability despite server faults. We
		 implement A2M and our protocols, evaluate them
		 experimentally through micro- and macro-benchmarks, and
		 argue that the improved fault tolerance is
		 cost-effective for a broad range of uses, opening up
		 new avenues for practical, more reliable services.",

                  malicious participants in a distributed system is
                  “equivocation”: making conflicting statements to
                  others. We present TrInc, a small, trusted component
                  that combats equivocation in large, distributed
                  systems. Consisting fundamentally of only a
                  non-decreasing counter and a key, TrInc provides a
                  new primitive: unique, once-in-alifetime
                  attestations.

                  We show that TrInc is practical,
                  versatile, and easily applicable to a wide range of
                  distributed systems. Its deployment is viable
                  because it is simple and because its fundamental
                  components—a trusted counter and a key—are already
                  deployed in many new personal computers today. We
                  demonstrate TrInc's versatility with three detailed
                  case studies: attested append-only memory (A2M),
                  PeerReview, and BitTorrent.

                  We have implemented
                  TrInc and our three case studies using real,
                  currently available trusted hardware. Our evaluation
                  shows that TrInc eliminates most of the trusted
                  storage needed to implement A2M, significantly
                  reduces communication overhead in PeerReview, and
                  solves an open incentives issue in BitTorrent. Mi-
                  crobenchmarks of our TrInc implementation indicate
                  directions for the design of future trusted

  abstract = "Cloud-based services are an attractive deployment model
                  for user-facing applications like word processing
                  and calendaring. Unlike desktop applications, cloud
                  services allow multiple users to edit shared state
                  concurrently and in real-time, while being scalable,
                  highly available, and globally
                  accessible. Unfortunately, these benefits come at
                  the cost of fully trusting cloud providers with
                  potentially sensitive and important data.

                  To overcome this strict tradeoff, we present SPORC, a
                  generic framework for building a wide variety of collabo-
                  rative applications with untrusted servers. In SPORC, a server
                  observes only encrypted data and cannot deviate from
                  correct execution without being detected. SPORC
                  allows concurrent, low-latency editing of shared
                  state, permits disconnected operation, and supports
                  dynamic access control even in the presence of
                  concurrency. We demonstrate SPORC's flexibility
                  through two prototype applications: a
                  causally-consistent key-value store and a
                  browser-based collaborative text editor.

                  Conceptually, SPORC illustrates the complementary benefits of
                  operational transformation (OT) and fork*
                  consistency. The former allows SPORC clients to
                  execute concurrent operations without locking and to
                  resolve any resulting conflicts automatically. The
                  latter prevents a misbehaving server from
                  equivocating about the order of operations unless it
                  is willing to fork clients into disjoint
                  sets. Notably, unlike previous systems, SPORC can
                  automatically recover from such malicious forks by
                  leveraging OT's conflict resolution mechanism. "

                  a wide variety of computing devices from cell phones
                  to Internet services. Selective replication of
                  content is essential because devices, especially
                  portable ones, have limited resources for storage
                  and communication. Cimbiosys is a novel
                  replication platform that permits each device to
                  define its own content-based filtering criteria and
                  to share updates directly with other devices.

                  In the face of fluid network connectivity, redefinable content
                  filters, and changing content, Cimbiosys ensures two
                  properties not achieved by previous systems. First,
                  every device eventually stores exactly those items
                  whose latest version matches its filter. Second,
                  every device represents its replication-specific
                  metadata in a compact form, with state proportional
                  to the number of devices rather than the number of
                  items. Such compact representation results in low
                  data synchronization overhead, which permits ad hoc
                  replication between newly encountered devices and
                  frequent replication between established partners,

                  tended to help multi-site applications share data
                  and gain fault tolerance. WheelFS takes the form of
                  a distributed file system with a familiar POSIX
                  interface. Its design allows applications to
                  adjust the tradeoff between prompt visibility of
                  updates from other sites and the ability for sites
                  to operate independently despite failures and long
                  delays. WheelFS allows these adjustments via
                  semantic cues, which provide application control
                  over consistency, failure handling, and file and
                  replica placement.

                WheelFS is implemented as a user-level file system and
                  is deployed on PlanetLab and Emulab. Three
                  applications (a distributed Web cache, an email
                  service and large file distribution) demonstrate
                  that WheelFS's file system interface simplifies
                  construction of distributed applications by allowing
                  reuse of existing software. These applications
                  would perform poorly with the strict semantics im-
                  plied by a traditional file system interface, but by
                  providing cues to WheelFS they are able to achieve
                  good performance. Measurements show that
                  applications built on WheelFS deliver comparable
                  performance to services such as CoralCDN and
                  BitTorrent that use specialized wide-area storage

                  research is access to personal and shared data
                  anywhere at anytime. In many ways, this vision is
                  close to being realized. Wireless networks such as
                  802.11 offer connectivity to small, mobile
                  devices. Portable storage, such as mobile disks and
                  USB keychains, let users carry several gigabytes of
                  data in their pockets. Yet, at least three
                  substantial barriers to pervasive data access
                  remain. First, power-hungry network and storage
                  devices tax the limited battery capacity of mobile
                  computers. Second, the danger of viewing stale data
                  or making inconsistent updates grows as objects are
                  replicated across more computers and portable
                  storage devices. Third, mobile data access
                  performance can suffer due to variable storage
                  access times caused by dynamic power management,
                  mobility, and use of heterogeneous storage
                  devices. To overcome these barriers, we have built a
                  new distributed file system called BlueFS. Compared
                  to the Coda file system, BlueFS reduces file system
                  energy usage by up to 55% and provides up to 3 times

                  few general-purpose computers to make CEDs first
                  class clients of the file system. It supports
                  namespace diversity by translating between its
                  distributed namespace and the local namespaces of
                  CEDs. It supports extensibility through persistent
                  queries, a robust event notification mechanism that
                  leverages the underlying cache consistency protocols
                  of the file system. Finally, it allows mobile
                  clients to self-organize and share data through
                  device ensembles. Our results show that these
                  features impose little overhead, yet they enable the
                  integration of emerging platforms such as digital
                  cameras, MP3 players, and DVRs." ,

  annote = {LBFS uses an rsync-like approach to reduce network traffic by comparing chunks of the remote and local files and only sending data that has changed across the network. They solved one of the main problems with rsync, namely that if a change happens towards the beginning of a file the rsync algorithm has the potential of being required to sync all chunks after the change. By using a sliding window based on Rabin's fingerprint, the LBFS attempts to chunk files based on their content, not on a fixed chunk size; thereby allowing insertions and deletions to only affect surrounding chunks.
~
The innovation of this paper therefore is the use of a variable chunk size to perform synchronization over the network by comparing the hashes of chunks and only transmitting any required chunk of data. This approach also allows LBFS to sync chunks from multiple files rather than comparing by file name by using the chunk hashes a broad sketch for the contents of any file.
~
My concern with this file system is that it uses timestamps and TCP to ensure consistency. Although a three tiered system included leases is used to determine change; these leases are measured by the attributes of a timestamp on both the client and the server. Synchronization of the clocks could become a huge issue. Additionally, although they use a temporary file to prevent errors or corruption and rely on the the ordered nature of TCP to ensure that a commit always happens after all the writes; it feels like the possibility exists for two clients to be writing to the file and the same time to manage to corrupt a file through bad timing or bad clocks. This filesystem was designed for a single client to access a remote file system at a time, not to have multiple clients sharing the same file system.},

  annote = {Peer-to-peer systems are dynamic and robust because no node is more important than any other node; this leads to fault tolerance and network adaptation, but also a significant challenge: how do you efficiently locate data in a peer-to-peer network? There is no one oracle that knows the location of everything to ask, so you have to engage in a game of telephone with other computers to find what you're looking for. How to efficiently go about this game is the problem that Chord solves. The innovation of the Chord system is the implementation of a \_key-node\_ data storage system. Unlike a key-value store where, given some key you are able to quickly find a value, the key-node store utilizes the key to report the location of the closest node that is assigned the key. It does this by utilizing a ring topology with a consistent hashing algorithm to assign key/identifiers pairs to each node in the network. The ring topology ensures that~ nodes that enter and exit the network minimize disruption (and they have implemented algorithms to handle failures and resizing of the network) - but more importantly it ensures the following two theorems, proved in the paper:1. Each node only has to store information about local nodes, about O(log \_N\_) and therefore lookups only require that same amount of information. 2. When the nth node leaves the network, with high probability only O(1/n) fraction of keys must be moved, ensuring load balancing.These are fantastic claims for the effeciency of a distributed system, and the authors do a very good job of demonstrating proofs for their claims; including probability density functions along with their simulation results to show the likelihood of the orders discussed above. I especially liked the idea that with a flat keyspace; names could be anything and DNS-style lookups might not be required in a network configured with Chord.My primary critique of this paper centers around the idea that every node can connect to every other node; as in the simulation. In section 6.1 they state that Chord can operate in two modes: \_iterative\_ where the requesting node makes routing requests until it finds the node it was looking for and \_recursive\_ where requests are forwarded along the network and then back again. The simulation that they reported was for the \_iterative\_ method. The problem is, that an \_iterative\_ method does require some routing capability alongside the nodes to send network traffic correctly to the right node. Clearly the authors had an Internet system in mind when they designed this; but what about a dynamic network topology? It would seem that in this case, the \_recursive\_ method would bog down the nodes in keyspace requests and that the O(log\textsuperscript{2} \_N\_) messages for routing updates would actually end up being O(\_N\_ log\textsuperscript{2} \_N\_).},

  annote = {OceanStore is an interesting paper - it explores the topic of persistent information storage in a world of many high performing, interconnected computing devices. The problem of storage is no longer local to a single machine (storage is cheap for that machine), because the machines outnumber humans. Therefore the multiple machines that a human uses in multiple locations will have to have access to the same information in a transparent, secure and durable manner. The question then becomes, where should that information be stored?
~
OceanStore proposes a uniform, distributed infrastructure for data storage (an ocean, not a cloud) based on the availability of connectivity and cheap storage; OceanStore is a data management layer on top of storage. The user will know nothing about where the data is located, just that it's always available. Importantly, OceanStore proposes a global infrastructure, meaning that only a world-wide disaster would cause data loss.
~
There seems to be no single innovation that you can point to in this paper; the innovation is rather the integration of several ideas into a concerted whole, with a particular emphasis on security. The first is the idea of using self-certifying path names that are hashed with identifiers to act as GUIDs for the objects in the data store, a second is the use of encryption for both read and write access control. The third is a way of using ECB encryption to ensure that block-level updates and block-based management of files can be implemented in a system that contains all encrypted files. A fourth is the distributed routing that combines attenuated bloom filters for pobabilistic routing with the Plaxton location based routing algorithm as a fall back.
~
The fifth idea is the use of Byzantine agreement protocols to handle serial updating in the network. A sixth is the use of deep archival storage for versioning, but also importantly using tornado or other erasure marking algorithms for deletion. Finally, the last idea (that I'll mention) is the use of introspection to maintain the cluster as it persists for a long time.
~
There are probably more ideas that I didn't mention that are embedded in this paper, but all of these ideas drive to one theme: a secure, global data infrastructure that provides low-latency access to a user's data anywhere. It's hard to critique these ideas; except to say that the emphasis on security, particularly in a global context is absolutely required and I approve of the authors focusing on it. One comment that I should make, though, is that OceanStore requires a global distributed network in order to function in the manner described; the implementation of such an infrastructure would require not just technological changes, but also policy and social ones as well.},

  annote = {Mobile computing environments particularly those that involve laptops or cell phones have less than ideal connectivity. Laptops, even with the profusion of wireless networks will have generally less bandwidth traveling than their desktop counterparts attached to broadband lines. Cell phones are charged by the minute and most applications should not consider cellular connectivity as a constantly on pipe. Moreover, computing happens in scary places like in University libraries where folks undertaking bibliographic data entry may find themselves "subject to student hackers" (page 2, last paragraph of section 2.2).~
~
Bayou provides a data infrastructure for collaborative applications in such environments through an eventually consistent peer-to-peer data transfer protocol. Eventually consistent systems mean that if no new writes are added all applications will have the same state eventually depending on connectivity, latency, and various policies. The key innovation of this paper stems from thought about dealing with conflicts.~
~
Bayou nodes synchronize data routinely through "anti-entropy" protocols that are designed to synchronize write logs. Every write has a dependency check associated with it as well as an application-specific conflict resolution. Two servers exchange data compare their logs in time order then replay writes along with the conflict resolutions so that when the sync is done, both servers have the same data. These anti-entropy synchronizations happen on demand as clients and servers are connected to the network ensuring that everyone is updated eventually.~
~
Every write is marked tentative until some primary server responsible for the application deems it time to commit. Tentative writes must have conflict resolution applied in order to sort out the state of the data; but committed data is accepted without~ quorum. Even if the primary is not attached to the network, when it does become attached the commits will spread through the network. Having a primary seems like a useful and simple way of achieving a committed write, but it does add extra burdens to the network. The primary machine can't be down for long; and if that machine resides on campus or on a specific local network, it might be a long time before mobile devices can get commits, which could impair the functionality of many applications especially time sensitive ones like meeting schedulers.~
~
I think it is necessary that Bayou considered the access controls of a system like this - tentative writes and primary systems pose potential problems for access. On the one hand Bayou could be implemented on a trusted network, but the peer-to-peer sharing aspects are what make the eventual consistency work. However, the idea of a certificate purse doesn't seem too innovative; especially when keys might be shared in the same eventually consistent manner. The access control aspects seemed tacked on and could use more thought.~},

Middleware system sits between clients and replica servers, routing the client to the appropriate type of replica server.
Middleware implements global version number as well as a client specific session version number and reconciles the replica version number.
Correctness criteria specify requirements on legal sequence of transaction execution that will leave replicas equivalent to each other according to concurrent access.
Divergence bound specifies how far replica states may diverge from correct system state before being brought up to date by propagating updates.
Also used a simulation model - did not take into account latency, but rather number of replicas, clients, update probability, think time, conflict time, divergence, number of data items and their size, min reads/writes, and read and write time.
Observed behavior as \# of clients increased as well as correctness criteria increased according to network traffic, number of conflicts, number of update propagation messages, and average response time.},
