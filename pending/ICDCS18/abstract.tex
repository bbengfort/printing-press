Eventually consistent systems can be made more consistent by reducing the time
until a write is fully replicated, improving global visibility of updates.
While gossip-based anti-entropy methods scale well, random selection of
anti-entropy partners is less than efficient.
Moreover, while eventual consistency may be consistent enough in a single data
center, geographic replication increases visibility latency and leads to
externally observable inconsistencies.
In this paper, we explore an improvement to pairwise, bilateral anti-entropy;
instead of uniform random selection, we introduce reinforcement learning
mechanisms to assign selection probabilities to replicas most likely to have
information.
The result is more efficient replication, faster visibility, and stronger
eventual consistency while maintaining high availability and partition
tolerance.
