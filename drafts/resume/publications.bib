	abstract = {The task of identifying proper names of people, organizations, locations, or other entities is a subtask of information extraction from natural language documents. This paper presents a survey of techniques and methodologies that are currently being explored to solve this difficult subtask. After a brief review of the difficulties and challenges of the task, as well as a look at previous conventional approaches, the focus will shift to a comparison of stochastic and gazetteer based approaches. Several machine-learning approaches are identified and explored, as well as a discussion of knowledge acquisition relevant to recognition. This paper will show that applications that require named entity recognition will be served best by some combination of knowledge-based and non-deterministic approaches.},

In this video tutorial, hosts Benjamin Bengfort and Jenny Kim discuss the core concepts behind distributed computing and big data, and then show you how to work with a Hadoop cluster and program analytical jobs. You’ll also learn how to use higher-level tools such as Hive and Spark.},

In recent years, Natural Language Processing techniques have accelerated our ability to stochastically mine data from unstructured text but require large training data sets themselves to produce meaningful results. Simultaneously the growth of distributed computational architectures and file systems have allowed data scientists to deal with larger volumes of data; clearly there is common ground that can allow us to achieve spectacular results.

The two most popular open source tools for both NLP and Distributed Computing, The
Natural Language Toolkit and Apache Hadoop, are written in different languages Python and Java. We will discusses the methodology to integrate them using Hadoop’s Streaming interface which sends and receives data into and from mapper and reducer scripts via the standard file descriptors.},
