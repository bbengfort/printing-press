# Homework Number 2

## Team Members and Details

- Benjamin Bengfort
- Konstantinos Xirogiannopoulos

Working with Gephi rather than NodeXL because we both have Macs.

Network chosen: network extracted from our email. See the [tribe](https://github.com/districtdatalabs/tribe) project for the Python code to extract a GraphML from an Mbox that you can download from Gmail.

## Project Description

**Homework #2: Network analysis using NodeXL** (_Due on Monday 6pm, April 6, 2015_)

You may form your own team of two people (who you are not working with on other projects) and let me know by Monday noon March 16, then I will assign teams and post through Piazza.

Use [NodeXL](http://www.codeplex.com/nodexl) to analyze and display your social media or other network. Get a network to work with (100-1000 nodes is reasonable, but larger or smaller ones like the class members are acceptable). See examples and get data sets from the [NodeXL Graph Gallery](http://www.nodexlgraphgallery.org). You can get a network from any one of these sources:

1. Import part of your Outlook email using NodeXL
2. Import a twitter/youtube/flickr network using NodeXL
3. Import a publication citation or other network
4. Create a network, e.g. the partnerships in this course, your family/friends, or a citation network

Explore with NodeXL, then describe the data, create 3 screengrabs with 3 headlines of what you found. For each headline, add a paragraph of text explaining what you did and a paragraph of what you found that was an interesting insight. Close with a paragraph critique of your NodeXL experience, describing positive aspects, problems you encountered, and suggestions for improvements.

If you prefer, you may use Gephi for this homework. If you want to use other tools, please send me email.

Link to your PDF report below in the wiki. Always include you names, emails, and the date.
