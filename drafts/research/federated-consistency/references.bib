  abstract = {Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log. It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems. In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majorities to guarantee safety.},

  abstract = "Cloud-based services are an attractive deployment model
                  for user-facing applications like word processing
                  and calendaring. Unlike desktop applications, cloud
                  services allow multiple users to edit shared state
                  concurrently and in real-time, while being scalable,
                  highly available, and globally
                  accessible. Unfortunately, these benefits come at
                  the cost of fully trusting cloud providers with
                  potentially sensitive and important data.

                  To overcome this strict tradeoff, we present SPORC, a
                  generic framework for building a wide variety of collabo-
                  rative applications with untrusted servers. In SPORC, a server
                  observes only encrypted data and cannot deviate from
                  correct execution without being detected. SPORC
                  allows concurrent, low-latency editing of shared
                  state, permits disconnected operation, and supports
                  dynamic access control even in the presence of
                  concurrency. We demonstrate SPORC's flexibility
                  through two prototype applications: a
                  causally-consistent key-value store and a
                  browser-based collaborative text editor.

                  Conceptually, SPORC illustrates the complementary benefits of
                  operational transformation (OT) and fork*
                  consistency. The former allows SPORC clients to
                  execute concurrent operations without locking and to
                  resolve any resulting conflicts automatically. The
                  latter prevents a misbehaving server from
                  equivocating about the order of operations unless it
                  is willing to fork clients into disjoint
                  sets. Notably, unlike previous systems, SPORC can
                  automatically recover from such malicious forks by
                  leveraging OT's conflict resolution mechanism. "

  annote = {Mobile computing environments particularly those that involve laptops or cell phones have less than ideal connectivity. Laptops, even with the profusion of wireless networks will have generally less bandwidth traveling than their desktop counterparts attached to broadband lines. Cell phones are charged by the minute and most applications should not consider cellular connectivity as a constantly on pipe. Moreover, computing happens in scary places like in University libraries where folks undertaking bibliographic data entry may find themselves "subject to student hackers" (page 2, last paragraph of section 2.2).~

Bayou provides a data infrastructure for collaborative applications in such environments through an eventually consistent peer-to-peer data transfer protocol. Eventually consistent systems mean that if no new writes are added all applications will have the same state eventually depending on connectivity, latency, and various policies. The key innovation of this paper stems from thought about dealing with conflicts.~
~
Bayou nodes synchronize data routinely through "anti-entropy" protocols that are designed to synchronize write logs. Every write has a dependency check associated with it as well as an application-specific conflict resolution. Two servers exchange data compare their logs in time order then replay writes along with the conflict resolutions so that when the sync is done, both servers have the same data. These anti-entropy synchronizations happen on demand as clients and servers are connected to the network ensuring that everyone is updated eventually.~
~
Every write is marked tentative until some primary server responsible for the application deems it time to commit. Tentative writes must have conflict resolution applied in order to sort out the state of the data; but committed data is accepted without~ quorum. Even if the primary is not attached to the network, when it does become attached the commits will spread through the network. Having a primary seems like a useful and simple way of achieving a committed write, but it does add extra burdens to the network. The primary machine can't be down for long; and if that machine resides on campus or on a specific local network, it might be a long time before mobile devices can get commits, which could impair the functionality of many applications especially time sensitive ones like meeting schedulers.~
~
I think it is necessary that Bayou considered the access controls of a system like this - tentative writes and primary systems pose potential problems for access. On the one hand Bayou could be implemented on a trusted network, but the peer-to-peer sharing aspects are what make the eventual consistency work. However, the idea of a certificate purse doesn't seem too innovative; especially when keys might be shared in the same eventually consistent manner. The access control aspects seemed tacked on and could use more thought.~},
