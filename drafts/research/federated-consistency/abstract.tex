Groups of strongly consistent devices can efficiently replicate data under
ideal (data center) conditions, but become less effective in dynamic and
heterogeneous environments.
Eventually consistent devices efficiently tolerate both faults and dynamic
conditions but are slow to converge on a single ordering of system events.

We propose ``federated consistency'', an approach that combines the strengths
of both approaches into a single protocol, Federated groups use a strongly
consistent inner core of devices to maintain a totally ordered, fault-tolerant
sequence of events.
A cloud of eventually-consistent devices disseminates orderings and enables
progress despite varying connectivity and partitions.

We use a detailed event simulation to show the key advantages of 
Events

eventually consistent devices.
A group of federated devices uses provide the majority of benefits
obtained from both approaches.
