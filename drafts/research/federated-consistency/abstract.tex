Groups of strongly consistent devices can efficiently replicate data under
ideal (data center) conditions, but become less effective in dynamic and
heterogeneous environments.  Eventually consistent devices efficiently
tolerate both faults and dynamic conditions but are slow to converge on a
single ordering of system events.

We propose ``federated consistency'', an approach that combines the strengths
of both approaches into a single protocol. Federated groups use a strongly
consistent inner core of devices to maintain a totally ordered, fault-tolerant
sequence of events.  A cloud of eventually-consistent devices disseminates
orderings and enables progress despite varying connectivity and partitions.
We use a detailed event simulation to show that a group of federated devices
can obtain the key advantages of both approaches.
