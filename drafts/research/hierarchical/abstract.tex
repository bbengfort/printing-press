Distributing data storage systems across wide geographic areas provides resilience to
catastrophic failure and improves performance by localizing user access.
However, as network distance increases, the impact of failure modes such as partitions
and communication variability pose significant challenges to coordination that impair
strong consistency, particularly when systems scale beyond a handful of replicas.
In order to balance consistency and performance in a multi-region context, geo-distributed
consensus must be flexible, adapting to changing network conditions and user behavior.
In this paper, we introduce \sys, a hierarchical consensus protocol that implements and
extends Vertical Paxos, designed to implement large, strongly-consistent and adaptable
geo-replicated consensus groups.
\sys splits coordination responsibility across two tiers: a \roo responsible for
safely moving the system through reconfigurations, and \subs that manage accesses.
\Subs intersect with the \roo using a novel method, delegated voting, which ensures that
all replicas participate in both consensus tiers and provide transparent, linearizable
guarantees across the entire system.
This design ensures \sys can optimize throughput and availability by flexibly changing
its configuration in real-time to meet demand without sacrificing consistency.
