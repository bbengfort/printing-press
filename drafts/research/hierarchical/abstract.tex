We introduce Hierarchical Consensus (HC), an understandable implementation
and extension of Vertical Paxos designed to create large,
strongly-consistent geo-replicated distributed systems.
HC uses partitions across multiple independent \subs to increase overall
availability, localize decision-making, and improve throughput.
\Subs can be lightweight and chosen from hosts with low mutual communication
latencies such that co-location and balanced load allow them to reach
decisions quickly.
Globally, a \roo maintains the decision-space and provides linearizable
guarantees across the entire system by intersecting with \subs using a novel
delegation approach to voting.
We demonstrate HC's advantages through an implementation scaling to hundreds
of replicas across more than a dozen availability zones around the world
using Amazon EC2.
