% Primary problem statement
As data systems have scaled to accommodate increasing load and requirements for
geographic replication across the wide area, they have also increased in complexity.
Engineering based solutions to coordinate hundreds of replicas involve multiple,
independent process and quorums to synchronize time, allocate locks, manage transactions,
and recover from failure.
Although these systems provide strong consistency, they do so in an rigid, opaque manner
that is not flexible enough for general use.

% Needs to be better
In this paper we introduce Alia, an implementation and extension of Vertical Paxos
designed to create large, strongly-consistent geo-replicated systems.
Alia is a hierarchical consensus protocol that splits coordination across two tiers: a
root quorum partitions subquorums across the namespace, each of which directly manage
accesses to the data.
To ensure that all replicas participate in both consensus tiers and provide transparent,
linearizable guarantees across the entire system, subquorums intersect with the root
quorum using a novel method: delegated voting.
Alia is scalable, adaptable, and able to export an externalizable log of all accesses to
the system.
We demonstrate its advantages through an implementation scaling to hundreds of replicas
across more than a dozen availability zones around the world using Amazon EC2.
