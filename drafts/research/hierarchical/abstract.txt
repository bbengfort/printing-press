We introduce Hierarchical Consensus (HC), a new approach to generalizing and localizing distributed consensus.  HC is well-suited for large, dynamic, and geo-replicated groups of hosts.  Hierarchical Consensus uses partitions among multiple subquorums to increase overall availability, localize decision-making, and improve throughput.

The key novelty is in allowing multiple decision-making subquorums to run independently.  Subquorums can be lightweight, and chosen from hosts with low mutual communication latencies.  Multiple independent subquorums increase the system's overall throughput, while their small sizes and co-location allow them to reach decisions quickly.  A root quorum maintains the decision-space partition and provides linearizable guarantees across the entire system.  We demonstrate HC's advantages through an implementation running on Amazon EC2.
