Eventual consistency systems can be made more consistent by improving the
visibility of a write, that is the time until a write is fully replicated.
Gossip based anti-entropy methods scale well but random selection of
anti-entropy partners results in less than efficient replication.
We propose a simple improvement to pairwise, bilateral anti-entropy; instead
of uniform random selection we introduce reinforcement learning mechanisms
which assign selection probabilities to replicas most likely to have
information.
The result is efficient replication, faster visibility, and higher
consistency, while still providing high availability and partition tolerance.
