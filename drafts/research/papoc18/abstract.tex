Eventually consistent systems can be made more consistent by reducing the time
until a write is fully replicated, improving their visibility.
While gossip-based anti-entropy methods scale well, random selection of
anti-entropy partners is less than efficient.
We propose an improvement to pairwise, bilateral anti-entropy; instead
of uniform random selection, we introduce reinforcement learning mechanisms
to assign selection probabilities to replicas most likely to have
information.
The result is more efficient replication, faster visibility, and higher
consistency, while maintaining high availability and partition tolerance.
